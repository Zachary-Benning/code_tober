Simple -Blog- covering my fun coding practice experience during the month of october.

The vast majority of these problems come from a collection of websites and textbooks that I have.

I have a math degree from BYU-I.  I have been persuing a Ph.d from University of Idaho in Computer science for a few years now.
Every october I try to make sure that I have the technical chops to at least make it into a top company, at least past the technical interviews.

This is by no means an exhaustive set of concepts or skills required for a mastery of 'programming'/'coding' these are just a few that I can do and share openly with the public.

This will be my first year sharing this experience so fun times
