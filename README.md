Rebel to rejection.
Reject to be a renegade.
Do it because it pushes past what you think you can do.
NO GAMES, NO Leisure, JUST CODING PUZZLES/Problems for 31 days straight.  
Code more in 31 days than you have in the past year!

Simple -Blog- covering my fun coding practice experience during the month of october.

The vast majority of these problems come from a collection of websites and textbooks that I have.

Every october I try to make sure that I have the technical chops to at least make it into a top company, at least pass the technical interviews.

This is by no means an exhaustive set of concepts or skills required for a mastery of 'programming'/'coding' these are just a few that I can do and share openly with the public.

This will be my first year sharing this experience so fun times

# Schema of Code_tober
8 Algorithmic interview style questions a day.
1 System Design concept a day studied and reviewed
NO AI SUPPORT
NO STACK SUPPORT

Step 1
  - Do Problem on paper/whiteboard.
  - Code and check
  - Write thoughts and time complexity

Step 2
  - Post to Code_tober blog

Step 3
  - Create Flash card with optimal solution (can use internet for this step)
      - optimal solutions within reason.  That is no code golfing style approaches.

Step 4
  - Review and study a single system design
  - Report it to the code_tober blog.
